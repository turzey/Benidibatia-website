        <p>At the point of writing this, I've been a web developer for over two years. It sounds not much as experience hahaha. Now if you've stumbled upon this post is to know a little bit about me, welcome!</p>
        <p>Now I am not a great blogger, but i love writing  and learning new stuffs as most  developers i am a life long learner. Friends and acquaintances have been telling me for the past few years that I should start sharing my thoughts and writing from time to time, so here I am after reading one too many articles about motivation and making things happen.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">I'm in uncharted territory at this point, and I am not sure whether my ideas are correct or even worth sharing, but I am hoping that some of you out there might get some value out of what I end up doing here, that's how i always get myself involve into things.</p>
      
        <p>Welcome to my website. Keep an eye out for more, and I'll keep myself honest about sharing some thoughts with you all. Until next time!</p>
